"@kaiord/core": patch
---

Test changeset for package-scoped release tags implementation. This is a dry-run test to verify:

- Package-scoped tag format (@kaiord/core@x.y.z)
- GitHub release creation with correct format
- Changelog extraction and formatting
- Multi-package release support

This changeset will be used to test the release workflow without publishing to npm.
