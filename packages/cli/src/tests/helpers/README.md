# Test Helpers

This directory contains shared test utilities for CLI tests.

## Utilities

- `cli-test-utils.ts` - Helper functions for running CLI commands in tests
  - `runCli()` - Execute CLI as child process
  - `createTempDir()` - Create temporary directories for test files

These utilities will be implemented in subsequent tasks.
