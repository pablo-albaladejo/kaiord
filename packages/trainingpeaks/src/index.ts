/**
 * @kaiord/trainingpeaks — TrainingPeaks health adapter for Kaiord.
 *
 * A PURE, offline adapter over the TrainingPeaks internal metrics API
 * (`tpapi.trainingpeaks.com`) `consolidatedtimedmetric(s)` payloads. It
 * performs no network I/O and contains no browser-extension code; it only
 * maps between KRD health documents and TrainingPeaks metric payloads.
 *
 * - Read side: `trainingPeaksMetricsToKrd` turns a
 *   `GET …/consolidatedtimedmetrics/{start}/{end}` response into KRD
 *   `weight_measurement` documents (weight `type 9`; other channels deferred).
 * - Write side: `krdWeightToTrainingPeaksMetric` turns a KRD weight into a
 *   `POST …/consolidatedtimedmetric` payload (weight `type 9`, value in kg).
 *
 * The live cookie→token→Bearer transport lives in `@kaiord/trainingpeaks-bridge`;
 * this package is transport-agnostic.
